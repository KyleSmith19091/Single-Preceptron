# Single-Preceptron
A basic implementation of a single perceptron neural network which is used to predict if provided with some cartesian coordinate if that value is above or below a pre determined straight line. The value 1 is returned if the coordinate is above the line and conversely the value -1 is returned if the coordinate is below the line.
